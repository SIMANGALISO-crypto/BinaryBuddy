# BinaryBuddy
AI research project to translate bytecode/binary into natural language explanations.

**Vision**  
BinaryBuddy is an open-source AI research project that aims to translate
low-level code (bytecode / binary) into natural language explanations.
The long-term goal is a language-agnostic AI that understands any
programming language from its compiled form.

## Current Prototype
This repo currently demonstrates:
* Disassembling Python `.pyc` files
* Generating a simple English explanation of the bytecode

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/BinaryBuddy.git
cd BinaryBuddy/prototype
python bytecode_demo.py
